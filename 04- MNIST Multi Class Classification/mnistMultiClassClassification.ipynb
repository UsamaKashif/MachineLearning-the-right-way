    "# MNIST Multi Class Classification\n",
    "In [**MNIST Binary Classification**](https://github.com/UsamaKashif/MachineLearning-the-right-way/tree/main/03-%20MNIST%20Binary%20Classification) we have seen how to classify binary classes using MNIST dataset. In this notebook, we will see how to classify multiple classes using MNIST dataset. We will use the same dataset but this time we will classify all the 10 classes.\n",

    "Here is the simple recipie for multiclass classification:\n",
    "- Build a binary classifier for each class\n",
    "- Combine the classifiers from each class into one multi-class classifier\n",

    "## Build a MultiClass Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](files/binaryClassifier.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighted Sum plus Sigmoid [WSS] is like a binary classifier, except that instead of returning either 0 or 1, it returns a floating-point number between 0 and 1. We build an array of ten WSSs, one per class from the 0 - 9. If we run them all we get an array of ten numbers\n",

    "## One Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](files/oneHotEncoding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This way of encoding labels is called one-hot encoding, because only one value per row is 11. The rest are zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t run our code ten times, once per class. Instead, we run it once, with one column per class. It’s as if each column in the matrix contained the binary encoding for one of the WSSs. This matrix multiplication-based approach works just as well as running a classifier ten times, but it’s much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decoding the Output\n",
    "\n",
    "During the classification phase, the WSSs return arrays of ten numbers from 0 to 1. But we do not want to see those arrays, we want a human-readable answer such as “3”. This means we need to decode the WSSs answers before returning them."
