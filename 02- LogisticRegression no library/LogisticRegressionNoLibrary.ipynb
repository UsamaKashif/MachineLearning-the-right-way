    "Linear Regression is all about approximating data with a line. It works well when the data is linearly separable. But when the data is not linearly separable, it fails to give good results. In such cases, we use Logistic Regression. Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm. It is used to predict a binary outcome (1 / 0, Yes / No, True / False) given a set of independent variables."

    "## Intro to Logistic Regression\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes). In logistic regression, the dependent variable is binary or dichotomous, i.e. it only contains data coded as 1 (TRUE, success, pregnant, etc.) or 0 (FALSE, failure, non-pregnant, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic regression model is a linear model for binary classification. It models the probability that an observation belongs to a category. If the probability is greater than 0.5, the model predicts that the observation belongs to that category. If the probability is less than 0.5, the model predicts that the observation does not belong to that category."
